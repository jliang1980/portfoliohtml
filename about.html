			<span class="dropcap">A</span>s I dig inside the myriad passageways that is my memory, I hope to pinpoint the one single defining moment that I decided I wanted to be a designer. Perhaps it came when I was in  grade school when during an arithmetic class I was listlessly working on some stylized typography and a couple of figure drawings. A visiting teacher from another classroom looked down at my drawings and said &quot;very nice.&quot; I was a little spooked and encouraged as well. 

			<br><br>Throughout high school I spent <img src="images/ago.png" class="img-top" alt="AGO Gallery" >my free time at the Ontario Art Gallery looking at coffee table books on design, and was introduced to the likes of Paul Rand and Saul Bass.  I also remember subscribing to a couple of indie type foundries so I could pour over their free catalogs.</p>

			<p class="normal">After high school, I decided very quickly to pursue to a career in web design. 
			
			It was the late 90&apos;s and web design was the &quot;hot new thing&quot;. Plus it seemed to perfect blend of technology and art to engage both hemispheres of my brain. I enrolled at a local career college to get a diploma in web design.</p>

			I began a freelance career that would sustain me while I pursued outside opportunities and schooling in between. Working clients with I learnt the art of communication to translate pieces of our conversation into a cohesive brand and story. I worked with all types of personalities. Eventually, I wanted to move beyond the visual design of a product. My education at bloc.io has been extremely fruitful.

			I learned to use empathy and data analysis to craft user-informed experiences.

			As a full stack designer, I have the ability to follow a product from UX research to UI prototypes and html/css/javascript development. 

			From my formative experiences sparked my interest in design, to my education and working with clients, I have learnt the process of research, empathizing with the user, and distilling  problems and stories. I am ready to craft well-informed user experiences for your team!
