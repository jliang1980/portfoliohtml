			<p class="normal">The client wanted to enter the cloud storage application market, but was faced with competing with seasoned companies already in the field ie Google, Dropbox, Box,
			Evernote, Pinterest, etc. They needed the right set of features to appeal to a particular audience. 
			</p>
			<h3 class="title ">Solution</h3>
			<p class="normal">In the user survey, I noticed that high percentages of users liked features that could be grouped under &quot;project management&quot;. I brainstormed to have all activity be centered around a &quot;project&quot;. Users can change and create projects. Each project has its separate file, messaging and tasks ecosystem.  I thought that a cloud storage application with light project management features could be the 
&quot;right&quot; set of features the client was looking to offer users to distinguish themselves from the pack.

			<p class="normal violet-type competitive">
			Google Drive is the clear winner among free space given to users with 
			15mb. Dropbox is the winner in filing sharing security. It can set
			passwords and expiry date when sharing files. Integrations with
			Office 365 makes Onedrive the top choice for using a office suite with cloud
			storage. Dropbox is also the winner in file syncing speed. For collaboration
			tools, all 3 competitors seem to offer real time authoring and file sharing.

			<p class="rec-text">A new competitor could concentrate on a core set of features for a niche audience, instead of trying to be the “cloud storage service for everyone” as the Big Three have done. I see that existing cloud storage providers do have collaboration features such as multi-level file sharing and real time authoring, However I envision all features to function on a per project level  with their unique set of tasks, file and messaging system for each project for optimal collaboration.</p>

			<h3 class="title violet-type">Branding</h3>
			<p class="normal violet-type"> The product is suited for anyone who wants to collaborate on a project together. It should appeal to both business and student users.  I am rejecting the corporate looking blue color scheme of Dropbox. I.would like the colors to hint at a fresh, playful 
			space to get the creative juices flowing when working on projects With these emotions in mind I created a moodboard from which I pulled the primary color to be fuschia. It should only be sprinkled in light splashes. Too much fuschia 
			can easily be overpowering and overly feminine.
			Next I created a styleguide to further solidify the design patterns. I chose accent colors 
			of grey, light blue and dark blue to balance out fuschia. Headlines and body text are 
			rendered in Roboto . It is simple, utilitarian and looks great on buttons.</p>

			<p class="normal violet-type">As the cloud storage application focuses on project management, I would like to focus the branding around the word &quot;collaboration&quot;. 
			From a mindmapping exercise, I found that the phrase to &quot;lend a hand&quot; had connections with collaboration. From the &quot;hands&quot; association I made a logo of  shaking hands inside the heart, the heart representing sharing and harmony.</p>

I found that users preferred a cut out oval picture of a group of people collaborating in front of the computer. Users preferred a smaller type size for the project toolbar on top of every page, as it is more &quot;elegant.&quot; They preferred a calendar with the task listings in the Task
			Manager versus without. Here are the 3 contenders from the hero image preference test:

			<p class="normal violet-type">Users received the visual aspects of the final design well. The suggestions for further refinements included the following. 
			- There was a form field that was &quot;unclear to the user what info should be entered.&quot;
			When uploading files to a new project, with the  drag and drop uploader there should also be  a link to &quot;browse for files&quot;.
			For the restore a document function, there should be a timestamp for each restore point would be make it much more useful. 
			There should be more attempts to use modern frameworks such as Material Design
			In the prototype.
			I implemented the technical issues above.  I also got rid of the folder styled tabs, and replaced with streamlined Material Design tabs. I also updated the right click menus by adding a drop shadow and deleting divider lines to also conform with  Material Design.
			Below are images of the before and after Material Design change.</p>

			<p class="normal" >I think that it was wise to pair fuschia ( to add a &quot;burst of energy&quot; to the app) with expanses of low chroma colors such as grey and light blue in the background. Negative feedback about the overall design was that it was &quot;a bit old fashioned&quot; and only had a &quot;splash of pink&quot;. to separate it from the wireframes. Immediately, I added more complementary colors and took to Material Design to update the look of some components. 
			My doubts going into the project were that the market is already saturated with cloud storage applications and it would be very hard to carve a niche. It genuinely surprised me that so many users were looking for a collaboration tools in cloud storage.</p>
