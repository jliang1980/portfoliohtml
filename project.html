			<h3 class="title">Problem</h3>
			<p class="normal">The client wanted to enter the cloud storage application market, but was faced with competing with seasoned companies already in the field ie Google, Dropbox, Box,
			Evernote, Pinterest, etc. They needed the right set of features to appeal to a particular audience. The client needed: - saving content from the web,
			- being able to create and organize documents
			- uploading files, social sharing 
			- real-time collaboration. 
			It was up to me, the UX designer, to test if those features appealed to audiences.
			</p>
			<h3 class="title ">Solution</h3>
			<p class="normal">In the user survey, I noticed that high percentages of users liked features that could be grouped under &quot;project management&quot;. I brainstormed to have all activity be centered around a &quot;project&quot;. Users can change and create projects. Each project has its separate file, messaging and tasks ecosystem. You cannot view other projects files, tasks or messages from within another project without switching to it. I thought that a cloud storage application with light project management features could be the 
&quot;right&quot; set of features the client was looking to offer users to distinguish themselves from the pack.

			<h3 class="title violet-type">Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<p class="normal violet-type">
I conducted a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Dropbox, and Onedrive - the three
 most used cloud storage services among my survey respondents. Comparison 
between these applications are summarized in the chart below.
</p>
<p class="normal violet-type competitive">
Google Drive is the clear winner among free space given to users with 
15mb. Dropbox is the winner in filing sharing security. It can set
passwords and expiry date when sharing files. Integrations with
Office 365 makes Onedrive the top choice for using a office suite with cloud
storage. Dropbox is also the winner in file syncing speed. For collaboration
tools, all 3 competitors seem to offer real time authoring and file sharing.

				<img src="images/maria.png" class="img-top" alt="maria">
				<p class="normal violet-type">
				With the data from the user survey, I constructed two user personas. Maria is a university student who acts as a project group leader. She detests piecing together paper bits of a project from other students. She wishes for real-time authoring tools for her fellow students, 
				being able to share a link to the project the professor, and built-in instant messaging tools.

				<img src="images/robert.png" class="img-bottom" alt="robert">
				<p class="normal violet-type">Robert is a web project manager for a Fortune 500 company. His team includes 
				remote workers from halfway around the world. He is interested in real-time co-authoring tools but only if it is not laggy and only if it shows who is authoring what on the screen. He would like an in-app messaging tool as well.</p>

			<p class="normal">Based on the research mentioned, I wrote out 20 user stories with nine high priority user stories that will be included in the Minimum Viable Product, and will be mapped out further with user flows.
			I took inspiration for mapping out the user flows from processes in Google and Dropbox. The user flow diagrams included flows for signing up for an account, creating a new project, organizing a file, sharing a file, uploading a file,  real-time co-authoring a document, seeing the file version history, sending messages to a teammate, and checking off completed tasks..</p>

			<h3 class="title violet-type">Branding</h3>
			<p class="normal violet-type"> The product is suited for anyone who wants to collaborate on a project together. It should appeal to both business and student users.  I am rejecting the corporate looking blue color scheme of Dropbox. I.would like the colors to hint at a fresh, playful 
			space to get the creative juices flowing when working on projects With these emotions in mind I created a moodboard from which I pulled the primary color to be fuschia. It should only be sprinkled in light splashes. Too much fuschia 
			can easily be overpowering and overly feminine.
			Next I created a styleguide to further solidify the design patterns. I chose accent colors 
			of grey, light blue and dark blue to balance out fuschia. Headlines and body text are 
			rendered in Roboto . It is simple, utilitarian and looks great on buttons.</p>

			<p class="normal violet-type">As the cloud storage application focuses on project management, I would like to focus the branding around the word &quot;collaboration&quot;. 
			From a mindmapping exercise, I found that the phrase to &quot;lend a hand&quot; had connections with collaboration. From the &quot;hands&quot; association I made a logo of  shaking hands inside the heart, the heart representing sharing and harmony.</p>

			<div class="projecthr white"></div>
			<p class="normal">I took the time to perform AB testing on few separate design issues. I found that users preferred a cut out oval picture of a group of people collaborating in front of the computer. Users preferred a smaller type size for the project toolbar on top of every page, as it is more &quot;elegant.&quot; They preferred a calendar with the task listings in the Task
			Manager versus without. Here are the 3 contenders from the hero image preference test:
			<ul class="signup">
				<li class="signup"><img src="images/signup1.png" class="center" alt="Signup 1"></li>
				<li class="signup"><img src="images/signup2.png" class="center" alt="Signup 2"></li>

			<div class="projecthr"></div>
			<p class="normal violet-type">Users received the visual aspects of the final design well. The suggestions for further refinements included the following. 
			- There was a form field that was &quot;unclear to the user what info should be entered.&quot;
			When uploading files to a new project, with the  drag and drop uploader there should also be  a link to &quot;browse for files&quot;.
			For the restore a document function, there should be a timestamp for each restore point would be make it much more useful. 
			There should be more attempts to use modern frameworks such as Material Design
			In the prototype.
			I implemented the technical issues above.  I also got rid of the folder styled tabs, and replaced with streamlined Material Design tabs. I also updated the right click menus by adding a drop shadow and deleting divider lines to also conform with  Material Design.

			<h2 class="centertitle up">What I learnt</h2>
			<div class="projecthr white"></div>
			<p class="normal" >I think that it was wise to pair fuschia ( to add a &quot;burst of energy&quot; to the app) with expanses of low chroma colors such as grey and light blue in the background. Negative feedback about the overall design was that it was &quot;a bit old fashioned&quot; and only had a &quot;splash of pink&quot;. to separate it from the wireframes. Immediately, I added more complementary colors and took to Material Design to update the look of some components. 
			My doubts going into the project were that the market is already saturated with cloud storage applications and it would be very hard to carve a niche. It genuinely surprised me that so many users were looking for a collaboration tools in cloud storage.</p>
