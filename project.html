			<h3 class="title">Problem</h3>
			<p class="normal">The client wanted to enter the cloud storage application market, but was faced with competing with seasoned companies already in the field ie Google, Dropbox, Box,
			Evernote, Pinterest, etc. They needed the right set of features to appeal to a particular audience. The client needed: - saving content from the web,
			- being able to create and organize documents
			- uploading files, social sharing 
			- real-time collaboration. 
			It was up to me, the UX designer, to test if those features appealed to audiences.
			</p>
			<h3 class="title ">Solution</h3>
			<p class="normal">In the user survey, I noticed that high percentages of users liked features that could be grouped under “project management”. I brainstormed to have all activity be centered around a “project”. Users can change and create projects. Each project has its separate file, messaging and tasks ecosystem. You cannot view other projects files, tasks or messages from within another project without switching to it. I thought that a cloud storage application with light project management features could be the “right” set of features the client was looking to offer users to distinguish themselves from the pack.

			<h3>USER PERSONAS</h3>
			<div class="60">
				<img src="images/maria.png" class="img-floatleft">
				<p class="floattext violet-type">With the data from the user survey, I constructed two user personas. Maria is a university student who acts as a project group leader. She detests piecing together paper bits of a project from other students. She wishes for real-time authoring tools for her fellow students, 
				being able to share a link to the project the professor, and built-in instant messaging tools.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p class="floattext violet-type">Robert is a web project manager for a Fortune 500 company. His team includes 
				remote workers from halfway around the world. He is interested in real-time co-authoring tools but only if it is not laggy and only if it shows who is authoring what on the screen. He would like an in-app messaging tool as well.</p>

			<h3 class="title">User Stories and User Flows</h3>
			<p class="normal">Based on the research mentioned, I wrote out 20 user stories with nine high priority user stories that will be included in the Minimum Viable Product, and will be mapped out further with user flows.
			I took inspiration for mapping out the user flows from processes in Google and Dropbox. The user flow diagrams included flows for signing up for an account, creating a new project, organizing a file, sharing a file, uploading a file,  real-time co-authoring a document, seeing the file version history, sending messages to a teammate, and checking off completed tasks..</p>
			<img src="images/userflow.png" class="middle" alt="User Flow Diagram">
			<p class="normal">After sketching a few ideas on paper, I started to wireframe the user flows in Figma. Again  I took  inspiration from Google and Dropbox user interface to keep the app 
			familiar to my users.</p>

			<h3 class="title violet-type">Branding</h3>
			<p class="normal violet-type"> The product is suited for anyone who wants to collaborate on a project together. It should appeal to both business and student users.  I am rejecting the corporate looking blue color scheme of Dropbox. I.would like the colors to hint at a fresh, playful 
			space to get the creative juices flowing when working on projects With these emotions in mind I created a moodboard from which I pulled the primary color to be fuschia. It should only be sprinkled in light splashes. Too much fuschia 
			can easily be overpowering and overly feminine.
			Next I created a styleguide to further solidify the design patterns. I chose accent colors 
			of grey, light blue and dark blue to balance out fuschia. Headlines and body text are 
			rendered in Roboto . It is simple, utilitarian and looks great on buttons.</p>
			<img src="images/styleguide.png" class="middle" alt="Styleguide">
			<p class="normal violet-type">As the cloud storage application focuses on project management, I would like to focus the branding around the word “collaboration”. 
			From a mindmapping exercise, I found that the phrase to “lend a hand” had connections with collaboration. From the “hands” association I made a logo of  shaking hands inside the heart, the heart representing sharing and harmony.</p>

			<h3 class="title violet-type">Hi-fi Mockups</h3>

			<hr class="white">
			<p class="normal">Users received the visual aspects of the final design well. The suggestions for further refinements included the following. 
			- There was a form field that was “unclear to the user what info should be entered.”
			When uploading files to a new project, with the  drag and drop uploader there should also be  a link to “browse for files”
			For the restore a document function, there should be a timestamp for each restore point would be make it much more useful. 
			There should be more attempts to use modern frameworks such as Material Design
			In the prototype.
			I implemented the technical issues above.  I also got rid of the folder styled tabs, and replaced with streamlined Material Design tabs. I also updated the right click menus by adding a drop shadow and deleting divider lines to also conform with  Material Design.

			<h2 class="centertitle violet-type">What I learnt</h2>
			<hr class="violethr">
			<p class="normal violet-type" >I think that it was wise to pair fuschia ( to add a “burst of energy” to the app) with expanses of low chroma colors such as grey and light blue in the background. Negative feedback about the overall design was that it was “a bit old fashioned” and only had “a splash of pink “ to separate it from the wireframes. Immediately, I added more complementary colors and took to Material Design to update the look of some components. 
			My doubts going into the project were that the market is already saturated with cloud storage applications and it would be very hard to carve a niche. It genuinely surprised me that so many users were looking for a collaboration tools in cloud storage.</p>
